## Required software
### Compiling
- [Make](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) (if on Windows)
### Emulating
- [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/)
## Compiling the OS
It's actually pretty simple. In the kernel folder, run `make bake`.
## Emulating the OS
In the `kernel` folder, run `make run` if you're emulating it on Linux or just click `run.bat` if you're on Windows.
